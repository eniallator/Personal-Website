      For the front end, I assisted with the development of a cross-platform
      form engine for a geographical data collection platform with web and
      mobile client apps. The project involved work on multiple projects for web
      and mobile using TypeScript, React, using a variety of build tools and
      other libraries.<br />
      The API server uses Scala with the cats library and the play web
      framework, as well as postgresql for any database interaction/migrations.

      I created a software solution for an Adidas football event, where I was
      tasked with hooking up a big LED display (showing leaderboards/current
      game stats), alongside two tablet displays (one for team registration, the
      other for choosing which teams are up next), as well as a laptop display
      (for adding/removing goals scored and game functionality). I used an
      action/event system or communication over sockets as well as a REST API,
      where I created a few nodejs local packages, and wrote it all in
      typescript. I used a SQLite database for data storage about teams as well
      as games.<br />
      I worked under a lot of pressure, as I only had 8 days to complete this
      but managed to get everything working on time, even with many last minute
      changes.

      I developed a peer to peer streaming app which handled Motion Capture
      data, where there would be various producers of this data from different
      motion capture software. This would then be retrieved (over either a UDP
      connection, or directly through a DLL) by the app itself, which is written
      in electron. Next it would be sent over webRTC to the connected computers
      running the same app. Finally this data would be then sent from the app on
      the other end, to a data consumer, like the unity game engine.<br />
      For the unity side of the service, I developed some custom scripts to then
      take the motion capture data and animate a custom unity character.

      I created an interactive map embed, which displayed publication data
      (containing location data) provided by the university, to then be shown as
      points on a map. On the project I went from doing requirements analysis,
      to building a quote from doing time estimation for each feature. One of
      the requirements was to create a universal solution for any dataset. So I
      created a configuration, as well as a templating language in the form of
      markdown with some context processing, so that they had control over how
      the publications were being shown. This configuration was all contained
      within a single file, with YAML as front matter, and then markdown being
      the publication rich text format.

      I started work on an existing codebase as the sole developer, where I
      accomplished a number of tasks and worked across a few products. One of
      the tasks involved upgrading the Heroku stack from cedar-14 to heroku-18,
      where I also upgraded the minor Python version and it&apos;s dependencies.
      I also worked on custom Python client code, which communicated with the
      server&apos;s API, which I was also working on. I also introduced many
      unit tests, to help ensure reliability and give confidence that things
      work the way they should. Another one of the products I worked on was
      using the Firebase stack to host embeds, where they would be able to
      seamlessly fit into any page. These embeds would be able to receive custom
      styling/text content from the parent page to not disrupt the user
      experience/webpage interface.

      I added a complete new feature to the app all the way from specification
      to deployment to end users, with coding in Python, HTML and CSS and
      including automated testing. I learnt about using Django in the industry;
      implementing services and interacting with APIs. I learnt how to
      contribute and work with an existing codebase and also adhere to the
      standards already in place.<br />
      I also developed a new app for Buzzshot from idea to launchable product,
      on my own where I got handed a brief and I had control over the rest
      (including UI - front page as well).

      I gave a talk at a programming meetup (mainly about Javascript, but can be
      anything to do with programming) here in brighton called
      <a href="https://asyncjs.com/" target="_blank">asyncjs</a>. The talk was
      on how the map compression for my platformer game works, including the
      algorithm and the file format. I covered areas as complex as bit
      manipulation to an audience with different levels of experience in
      computer science. When I was talking to people afterwards, everyone seemed
      to understand the content in the presentation.

          <strong>Python:</strong><br />
          I started learning Python for my GCSEs and also used it for my
          A-Levels. I have since done many projects with it, including a
          <a href="https://github.com/eniallator/Discord-EniBot" target="_blank"
            >Discord bot</a

          which offers many miscellaneous commands. One of the commands is a

          <strong>Java:</strong><br />
          In my first year of university, we learnt Java. To better understand
          linear algebra (which I also learnt at that time), I created a
          <a
            href="https://github.com/eniallator/Matrix-Library-Java"
            target="_blank"
            >library</a
          >
          to do vector/matrix manipulations. I also challenged myself to create
          a
          <a
            href="https://github.com/eniallator/GOL-genetic-algorithm-java"
            target="_blank"
            >genetic algorithm for the game of life</a
          >
          in Java.

          <strong>GLSL:</strong><br />
          I have experience with GLSL when using the Love2D game engine for Lua.
          One of my projects was to create a
          <a
            href="https://github.com/eniallator/hypnotic-spiral-Love2D"
            target="_blank"
            >trippy/hypnotic spiral</a
          >
          for fun and it turned out to be pretty cool - I figured out how to
          make spirals in a 2D plane. Another project where I used GLSL for
          shading was my Platformer game, where I created a
          <a
            href="https://github.com/eniallator/platformer/blob/master/src/display.lua#L6-L58"
            target="_blank"
            >shader</a
          >
          to create scenes in the game like
