    <p><strong><a href="https://buzzshot.co/" target="_blank">Buzzshot</a>: Python Django Development</strong></p>
    <p>I added a complete new feature to the app all the way from specification to deployment to end users, with coding
        in Python, HTML and CSS and including automated testing. I learnt about using Django in the industry;
        implementing services and interacting with APIs. I learnt how to contribute and work with an existing codebase
        and also adhere to the standards already in place.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://buzzshot.co/" target="_blank">Buzzshot</a>: Flashair Project</strong></p>
    <p>I wrote Lua code to run on an embedded system housed in an SD Card to allow direct integration between DSLR
        Cameras and the Buzzshot system. I overcame the challenges of poor existing documentation and a small, niche
        community.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I delivered the project on time, within the work period</li>

    <p>I worked over the summer for google fonts as a developer in test using Python to write unit tests, as well as
        other miscellaneous tests. I learnt how to use git in a professional environment on a project with multiple
        contributors.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://uxbri.org/" target="_blank">UXBrighton</a>: Front-end Web Developer</strong></p>
    <p>Worked directly on the UXBrighton website using HTML, Javascript and CSS. When working, I had to keep in mind
        responsive web design principles and have learnt how to use them. I also helped getting the website to comply
        with the WCAG-A accessibility standards.</p>

    <p>I volunteered for a while at Codebar in brighton, an organisation whose goal is to get more under-represented
        groups into tech roles. I think it’s a fantastic cause which is why I did it. I found teaching there incredibly
        rewarding and also educational for me as I learned things when coaching.</p>
    <ul>

    <p><strong><a href="http://www.howreadable.com" target="_blank">Howreadable</a>: Experiment Development</strong></p>
    <p>I helped design the second iteration of this experiment which aims to collect empirical evidence on whether
        certain coding constructs/standards are more readable than their alternatives. I helped in defining the
        experimental method, the UX of the participant facing website, and designing and writing the code snippets used
        as test cases.</p>

    <p>I worked with the Unreal Engine where I made my own personal game mechanics. I had an insight into the games

    <ul>
        <li>Used the Unreal Engine’s blueprints for GUI programming</li>

    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/eniallator/platformer" target="_blank">Platformer Game</a>: Personal
            Project</strong></p>
    <p>A simple platformer game I created using the Love2D game engine which uses Lua to program. Towards the end of the
        project, I did shading for the game as well which was written using GLSL. The goal was to create everything
        myself and so I did; from physics to an ingame map editor and even down to the compression of those maps. I
        worked on it alongside college for 2 years.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/oYUof7JusKk" target="_blank">Platformer Map Compression</a>:
            Presentation</strong></p>
    <p>I gave a talk at a programming meetup (mainly about Javascript, but can be anything to do with programming) here
        in brighton called <a href="https://asyncjs.com/" target="_blank">asyncjs</a>. The talk was on how the map
        compression for my platformer game works, including the algorithm and the file format. I covered areas as
        complex as bit manipulation to an audience with different levels of experience in computer science. When I was
        talking to people afterwards, everyone seemed to understand the content in the presentation.</p>
    <p><strong>Programming Languages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Lua:</strong><br />
                I started off programming with Lua, creating scripts in the Minecraft mod: Computercraft. I created more
                and more complex scripts until I eventually had an entire working <a
                    href="https://pastebin.com/5jmNJF5V" target="_blank">GUI</a> for interacting with the in-game
                computers. I later found out about the Love2D game engine for Lua where I created many projects
                including the <a href="https://github.com/eniallator/platformer" target="_blank">platformer game</a>
                mentioned above.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Javascript:</strong><br />
                I moved on to NodeJS projects with the help of a tutor where I created many projects. I also do a lot of
                codegolfing using Javascript. I love doing HTML canvas animations, including: a <a
                    href="https://eniallator.github.io/pride-rainbow-animation/" target="_blank">rainbow I made for
                    celebrating pride</a>, <a href="https://eniallator.github.io/Circle-Segments-Animation/"
                    target="_blank">having fun with circles</a>, and a <a
                    href="https://eniallator.github.io/Sand-Piles-JS/" target="_blank">cellular automata sandpile
                    simulation</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Python:</strong><br />
                I started learning Python for my GCSEs and also used it for my A-Levels. I have since done many projects
                with it, including a <a href="https://github.com/eniallator/Discord-EniBot" target="_blank">Discord
                    bot</a> which offers many miscellaneous commands. One of the commands is a <a
                    href="https://github.com/eniallator/Discord-EniBot/blob/master/src/Commands.py#L92-L153"
                    target="_blank">text to emoji text</a> translator which works like <a
                    href="https://i.imgur.com/evWlN3W.png" target="_blank">this</a>. I have also done some <a
                    href="https://projecteuler.net/archives" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> challenges and have made
                a <a href="https://github.com/eniallator/Project-Euler-Python-answers" target="_blank">repository
                    containing my solutions</a> to them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Java:</strong><br />
                In my first year of university, we learnt Java. To better understand linear algebra (which I also learnt
                at that time), I created a <a href="https://github.com/eniallator/Matrix-Library-Java"
                    target="_blank">library</a> to do vector/matrix manipulations. I also challenged myself to create a
                <a href="https://github.com/eniallator/GOL-genetic-algorithm-java" target="_blank">genetic algorithm for
                    the game of life</a> in Java.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>GLSL:</strong><br />
                I have experience with GLSL when using the Love2D game engine for Lua. One of my projects was to create
                a <a href="https://github.com/eniallator/hypnotic-spiral-Love2D" target="_blank">trippy/hypnotic
                    spiral</a> for fun and it turned out to be pretty cool - I figured out how to make spirals in a 2D
                plane. Another project where I used GLSL for shading was my Platformer game, where I created a <a
                    href="https://github.com/eniallator/platformer/blob/master/src/display.lua#L6-L58"
                    target="_blank">shader</a> to create scenes in the game like <a
                    href="https://i.imgur.com/rFphaIr.png" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>I also have learnt <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> through work</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
